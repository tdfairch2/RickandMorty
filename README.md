# RickandMorty
Integrating Software and Hardware, specifically the Arduino Uno and Adafruit Pro-Trinket

This project is centered around an item in the Adult Swim cartoon "Rick and Morty"

Pin locations, source file links and the basic functionality is all provided in the Portal Gun document

Code alterations that I implemented are in the sketch "portalGun.ino", located in the PortalGun-master folder.  My changes to the original source code are indicated with more detailed comments than were included in the original.....\\|/
